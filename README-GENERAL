dbt2-0.37 has been extended quite a bit with a set of scripts that
make it possible to automate benchmark runs for Sysbench and DBT2.
All these scripts operate on top of a slightly changed DBT2 code
and the sysbench-0.4.12.5 version also made available as part of
this package.

See README-AUTOMATED for a description of the fully automated
benchmark run framework.

The new scripts are GPL licensed and thus there is also a
LICENSE.GPLv2 file in this distribution. The original code
and the extensions made in this distribution is covered by
the artistic license as described in the LICENSE file.

README-ICLAUSTRON contains a description of the lower level scripts
used to automate the benchmark runs. This description is useful for
anyone wanting to understanding the operation of the scripts a bit
more. The description is however a bit outdated.

README-MYSQL contains the lowest level of scripts in the DBT2 test
framework. This is also a bit outdated but can be useful to get a
better understanding of the operation of the benchmark runs.
